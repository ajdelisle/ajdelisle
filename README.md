- 👋 Hi, I’m @ajdelisle
- 👀 I’m interested more in the designing artistic aspects of digital learning, but learning coding as part of my program
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the full adobe suite, drawing, photography, video and sound, typography, graphic design, 
         UX/UI (my favorite), marketing, creative writing, html, css, javascript, php  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not too much right now, just using github for assignments
- 📫 How to reach me if you know of work in the UX/UI field you can email me ajdelisle@northislandcollege.ca
